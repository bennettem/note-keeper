# Note Taker

This application allows users to write and save notes in one spot. Once the user opens the application they are presented with the home page that links to a note keeper page. Once a user is at the note keeper page they are able to start creating their own notes. It's as simple as typing in a title and a small memo below. After all the user has to do is click the floppy disk on the top ribbon to keep their notes safe. If a user finds they no longer need a note anymore they can simply click the trash can icon next to the note and it will vanish.
